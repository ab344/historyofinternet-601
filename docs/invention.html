<u>The Invention of the Internet</u>
The internet is the global network of computer based communication and enables millions of people with personal
computers to connect and communicate. The internet is used for news groups, chat rooms, emails, and is the worlds
largest marketplace. This was the turn of the 21st century, where more emails are sent than actual first class mail
through the post office. No past invention has grown as fast as the internet, as well as touching so many lives.

Internet History Timeline

to login but the system crashed (ARPANET)

entertainment, news, dating, and as the biggest marketplace.
