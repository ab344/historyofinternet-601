<h3>The Dot Com Bubble</h3>
       <p>
       1995 was the start of a boom, something like no other, a world in which the commerce world was changed for the better. This mainly consisted of fiber optics and silicon chips. The Internet was a significant breakthrough compared to previous innovations. For example, the radio took 38 years before getting 50 million users. But for the Internet, it took only four years.</p>
       <p> The silicon chips caused this drive following Moore's law which states that the speed doubles every 18 months. The silicon chips' innovations grew in speed based on the etching to what materials the transistors are made of. By making chips denser and denser, it accomplished the Moore’s law easily.</p>
       <p> According to Robert Metcalfe, the ethernet founder, states that every new node added to the network counts more than one. The growth is steep compared to every. As the Internet's size increases, the Internet's usefulness increases, and it is more compelling for new users to join this phenomenon.</p>
       <p> Amazon was using the “Get big Fast” method to be the largest bookstore. As the Amazon and the Internet as a whole got bigger, Encryption was the key to secure internet users. The goal was to let the Amazon let users give vulnerable data during their purchases without letting someone tamper with the information during the transfer. A profound change occurred when public-key cryptography was introduced. It focused on the recipient being the only person to open the encrypted data. This concept calls for the sender to send a key lock to the receiver  and let the receiver lock the information and only allow the sender to unlock the information's contents.</p>
       <p> The Dot Com bubble was also affected wall street. With the introduction of the Internet, investors want a piece of what the future could give. The boom was its peak and inspired many new prospectors who want to get more decadent than Jeff Bassos. The unique ability to buy stocks from homes was the biggest magame changer as anyone could sit at home and invest in the stock market. These people are called day traders. Ecommerce companies were popping up at an alarming rate in order to whatever potential there could be.</p>
       <p> Fiber optic cables were another big phenomenon regarding the Dot Com boom. The advanced version of Morris code uses light pulses to carry digital information in an unimaginable rate compared to when Morris code was used. There was a huge influx to get everything to be connected with fiber.</p>
       <p> On April 14, 2000, the bust of the boom was black Friday, according to wall Street. The Dot Com bubble bust and September 11 closed off the remaining. Reality stuck for many companies as small were dealing with crippling sales and massive debt. Even though the ECommerce bubble bust, few still stand, including eBay and Amazon. The result of this Dot Com came in many new companies created, new jobs, and new opportunities as well as laying a new foundation to future that is none other.
