Communication is essential to a human being. Before the internet, companies decided how you communicated and made you pay for it on their own. The internet gave power to people to decide where they want to share. The internet opens up the distribution of content without any control.
	Before the internet, obtaining media was very inconvenient. It was a hassle to own music, as this required going to the music store, buying an album, and holding the whole album. With the new music revolution, it became easy to own just the one track you liked saving money being convenient. Although the music industry failed to grasp this upcoming new technology, services such as Napster only grew. Once the music industry started losing money, trading files online for free came to a halt.
	Napster was at the forefront, growing in popularity, yet the fury in the music industry was growing. Music was distributed for free to everyone on the service. Anyone could access music files as soon as it was released without any compensation to the creator or the record label. Lawsuits were filed left and right to shut down the music industry, thinking that this will help its losing profits. But companies such as Apple released their solutions, such as iTunes, which enabled the consumers to get the songs they wanted, and Google, which released YouTube.
	YouTube was another sensation that expanded the split from the conventional ways of the entertainment industry. Unlike Napster, Google acquired YouTube and gave the needed resources and opportunities to grow. YouTube offered the chance to individuals who did not have the knowledge or the resources to have spread their content to anyone on the web. Any content could be posted on YouTube, and this caused a lot of scrutiny to the company as any user could post copyrighted content. Although YouTube will take down any content that the media owner asked to take down, many media companies were not comfortable with the idea of having any chance to post content. Youtube was not alone, as many other companies started up, such as craigslist, Digg and myspace. From the wake of the dot com crash spawn new social media companies such as Friendster, myspace, etc. The popularity of myspace was caused by the sharing of music, overtaking Google at moments.
	Facebook was started as a small operation at a college campus, connecting college students. Yet, the ambition of Facebook was more than a website, trying to become the core foundation of communication for everyone. By creating a developer platform, and an advertisement platform, Mark Zuckerberg wanted to spread Facebook just as Bill Gates wanted every desk to have a Microsoft computer.
	Craigslist was the newfound go-to for many people, as the classified ads were easy to publish and available to anyone on the web. It caused a panic in the newspaper industry, allowing people to communicate for free than pay to post their classified advancements. Wikipedia was another result that promoted the education of the people with free information. This brought knowledge to ordinary average people giving access to information in a new way unlike any other giving the average person the author's right.
	The rise of the internet was growing opportunities that were unimaginable before. Millionaires were created overnight, and information was spread at a record pace. Moving the control from a few people to anyone would like to provide.
