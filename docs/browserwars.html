    <title>Browser Wars</title>

<body>
    A browser war is fighting for the dominance in the usage share of web browsers. The first browser war was held during
the late 1990’s between Microsoft and Netscape. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was attempting to dominate over
Netscape’s Navigator. There were other browser wars later on once more browsers were created. On October 13, 1994,
Netscape Navigator was released and instantly became a success. Netscape declared Microsoft as the “people to take
out.” There was a point when Netscape got a million downloads. Bill Gates imagined a future where the browser could be
an alternative platform, where you can carry out all of your computing needs online.
    Netscape’s business plan assumed that Microsoft would obey the law, and did not expect them to turn against them.
Bill Gates sent out a memo to his team titled “the internet tidal wave,” where he declared that the web was the “single
most important development in computing since pc” and Netscape was their competitor who Microsoft had to “match and
destroy.” Microsoft offered Netscape $1 million for unlimited access to all their technology for a one time fee,
assuring them that they would copy everything they do if they do not take their offer. That year, Netscape was the
fastest growing software company at the time with a $60-80 million revenue and insulted Microsoft claiming that
they have “poorly debugged device drivers.”
	In 1995, Bill Gates announced that he had Netscape on their sites, with the plan to “kill them off” with their new
browser, Internet Explorer. On the anniversary of Pearl Harbor, Microsoft attacked Netscape, where Microsoft emerged
triumph in September of 1997, causing the browser war to be over. A year later, Netscape’s market share was down to the
single digits and Microsoft had enough money to provide Internet Explorer for free.
	In 1998, The U.S. government declared Bill Gates as a high tech terrorist. Gary Reback launched an antitrust
lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing Microsoft of using its Windows monopoly to engage in a wide variety of predatory
and exclusionary business practices to prevent consumers from accessing Netscape’s products and destroying the
company’s success. An email was found that was sent by Bill Gates to his top people explaining the plan to execute a
powerful deal with Netscape and that he would like to buy a piece of them and would really like to see this happen. The
case was settled in 2001, requiring a third party company to have full access to Microsoft’s systems in order to ensure
compliance.
