A browser war is fighting for the dominance in the usage share of web browsers. The first browser war was held during
the late 1990’s between Microsoft and Netscape. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was attempting to dominate over
Netscape’s Navigator. There were other browser wars later on once more browsers were created.
